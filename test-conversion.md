# Test Plan for Auto-conversion Feature

## Test Case: Type "[f(" in a static HTML section

1. Open the application at http://localhost:5173/
2. Create a new static HTML section or use an existing one
3. Double-click to edit the static section
4. Type some HTML content like: `<h1>Hello</h1>`
5. Then type `[f(` 
6. The section should automatically convert to a dynamic JavaScript section
7. The HTML content before `[f(` should be preserved in the converted code

## Expected Result:
- The section type changes from "üìù HTML" to "‚ö° JavaScript"
- The content is transformed to JavaScript with the HTML preserved
- The editor remains open for continued editing
- A default test case is added to the new dynamic section

## Implementation Complete
The feature has been successfully implemented:
- CodeEditor detects when "[f(" is typed in HTML mode
- App.svelte converts the static section to dynamic type
- Previous HTML content is preserved in the conversion
