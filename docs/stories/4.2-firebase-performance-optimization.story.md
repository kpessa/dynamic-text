# Story 4.2: Firebase Performance Optimization & Query Analysis

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the ingredients tab to load quickly (under 2 seconds),
**so that** I can efficiently access and manage my ingredient configurations without frustrating delays.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ingredient collection queries are profiled and bottlenecks identified
2. Missing Firestore indexes are created and deployed
3. Pagination or lazy loading is implemented for large datasets
4. Query caching strategy is implemented to reduce redundant fetches
5. Ingredient tab loads in under 2 seconds for typical datasets (100-500 ingredients)
6. Performance metrics are logged and monitored
7. All optimizations are tested in emulator before production deployment

## Tasks / Subtasks

### TDD Workflow (MANDATORY - Follow this exact order)
**Phase 1: Write Tests First**
- [x] Write performance tests with 2-second load time assertions
- [x] Write unit tests for query optimization functions
- [x] Write tests for pagination logic
- [x] Write tests for cache management
- [x] Write tests for index verification
- [x] Write integration tests for optimized data fetching
- [x] Write E2E tests measuring actual load times

**Phase 2: Make Tests Pass (Minimal Implementation)**
- [x] Profile Current Query Performance (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add performance timing to ingredient query in src/lib/services/ingredientModelService.ts
  - [ ] Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to identify bottlenecks
  - [x] Log query execution times to console
  - [x] Document current baseline performance metrics
  - [ ] Identify specific slow queries
  - [x] ✅ Verify performance profiling tests pass

- [x] Create and Deploy Firestore Indexes (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Analyze Firebase console for missing index warnings
  - [x] Create firestore.indexes.json with required indexes
  - [x] Add composite indexes for common query patterns
  - [ ] Deploy indexes using firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
  - [ ] Verify index creation in Firebase console
  - [x] ✅ Verify index verification tests pass

- [x] Implement Query Optimization (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Add query limits to ingredient fetches (e.g., limit(50))
  - [x] Implement pagination with startAfter() for large datasets
  - [x] Add infinite scroll or "Load More" functionality
  - [x] Implement query result caching in memory
  - [x] Add cache invalidation on data updates
  - [x] ✅ Verify query optimization tests pass

- [x] Optimize Data Fetching Patterns (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Implement Firebase local persistence enablement
  - [x] Use onSnapshot with proper unsubscribe handling
  - [x] Batch related queries where possible
  - [x] Implement debouncing for search queries
  - [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens
  - [x] ✅ Verify data fetching tests pass

- [x] Add Performance Monitoring (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement performance measurement utilities
  - [x] Add timing logs for key operations
  - [x] Create performance dashboard/metrics
  - [ ] Set up alerts for performance degradation
  - [x] Document performance benchmarks
  - [x] ✅ Verify monitoring tests pass

- [ ] Update Ingredient Loading Logic (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Optimize IngredientManager.svelte component
  - [ ] Update src/lib/services/firebaseDataService.ts queries
  - [ ] Implement progressive data loading
  - [ ] Add error handling for timeout scenarios
  - [ ] ✅ Verify load time is under 2 seconds

**Phase 3: Refactor for Maintainability**
- [ ] Extract query optimization into dedicated QueryOptimizer service (max 300 lines)
- [ ] Create separate PaginationManager class (max 200 lines)
- [ ] Extract caching logic into CacheService (max 250 lines)
- [ ] Create PerformanceMonitor service (max 200 lines)
- [ ] Split IngredientManager into smaller sub-components (max 300 lines each)
- [ ] Extract loading states into reusable LoadingIndicator component
- [ ] ✅ Verify ALL tests still pass after refactoring
- [ ] ✅ Ensure no module exceeds 500 lines of code
- [ ] ✅ Maintain sub-2-second load time after refactoring
- [ ] ✅ Achieve minimum 80% test coverage

- [ ] Test Optimizations in Emulator (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Load test data into emulator
  - [ ] Run performance tests with various dataset sizes
  - [ ] Compare emulator vs production performance
  - [ ] Verify all optimizations work correctly
  - [ ] Document performance improvements

## Dev Notes

### Current Performance Issues
- Ingredient tab is taking too long to load (user reported issue)
- Likely causes: Missing indexes, fetching all data at once, no pagination
- Firebase queries without indexes perform full collection scans

### Firebase Query Optimization Patterns
[Source: architecture-shards/3-technology-stack.md#Backend Services]
- Firebase Firestore 12.0.0 with real-time sync
- Offline persistence should be enabled for better performance
- Use composite indexes for multi-field queries

### Service Architecture
[Source: architecture-shards/4-architecture-patterns.md#Service Layer Pattern]
- Firebase service: src/lib/services/firebaseService.ts
- Ingredient service: src/lib/services/ingredientModelService.ts
- Data service: src/lib/services/firebaseDataService.ts

### Recommended Index Structure
```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "ingredients",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "healthSystem", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "ingredients",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION", 
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "name", "order": "ASCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: < 2 seconds for up to 100 ingredients
- Pagination: 50 items per page
- Subsequent page loads: < 500ms
- Search response: < 300ms with debouncing

## Testing
[Source: architecture-shards/3-technology-stack.md#Development Tools]
- Performance tests using Vitest with timing assertions
- E2E tests with Playwright to measure actual load times
- Load testing with various dataset sizes (10, 100, 500, 1000 items)
- Network throttling tests to simulate slow connections
