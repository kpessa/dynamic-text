## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Order:
1. **Start with Phase 0** - Quick wins, immediate value
2. **Implement Phase 1** - Basic versioning gives safety
3. **Evaluate needs** - Decide if you need more complexity
4. **Phase 2 OR Phase 3** - Choose based on priority:
   - Phase 2 if you need baseline comparison
   - Phase 3 if duplicate management is more important
5. **Phase 4** - Only if you need advanced features

### Minimum Viable Implementation:
- Phase 0 + Phase 1.1-1.2 = Basic version tracking
- Add Phase 3.1-3.3 = Deduplication
- Total: ~2-3 days of work for core functionality

### Full Implementation:
- All of Phases 0-3 = ~2 weeks
- Phase 4 = Additional 1 week

## Notes

### Technical Decisions Made:
- [x] Use Firebase subcollections for versions (implemented)
- [x] Store full snapshots (implemented)
- [x] Hash algorithm choice: djb2 (fast, collision-resistant for our use case)
- [x] Auto-deduplication: Pre-process shared ingredients before batch operations

### UI/UX Decisions Made:
- [x] Show version status as badge on ingredient cards (implemented)
- [x] Modal diff viewer (implemented in VersionHistory component)
- [x] Sharing indicators: Subtle badges with hover details
- [x] Save model: Explicit save with Ctrl+S and commit messages
- [x] Preferences: Settings gear in navbar for user configuration

### Risk Mitigation:
- Each phase is independently valuable
- Can stop at any phase and have working system
- Phase 0-1 provides immediate safety (version history)
- Later phases are optional enhancements
