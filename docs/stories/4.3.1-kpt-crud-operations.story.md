# Story 4.3.1: KPT Namespace CRUD Operations

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** medical content creator,
**I want** to create, edit, and delete custom KPT functions dynamically,
**so that** I can extend and customize the KPT namespace with project-specific medical calculations without requiring code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create new KPT functions through a UI interface
2. Custom KPT functions are persisted and available across sessions
3. Users can edit existing custom KPT functions (both built-in metadata and custom functions)
4. Users can delete custom KPT functions (built-in functions cannot be deleted)
5. Custom functions are validated for syntax and safety before saving
6. Custom functions are accessible via me.kpt namespace alongside built-in functions
7. Function changes are versioned and auditable
8. Export/import functionality for sharing custom KPT function libraries

## Tasks / Subtasks

### TDD Workflow (MANDATORY - Follow this exact order)
**Phase 1: Write Tests First**

- [ ] Split KPTFunctionEditor into sub-components (max 300 lines each)
  - [ ] KPTFunctionForm component
  - [ ] KPTFunctionPreview component
  - [ ] KPTFunctionValidator component
- [ ] Create KPTVersionManager for history tracking (max 250 lines)
- [ ] Extract export/import into KPTLibraryService (max 300 lines)
- [ ] ✅ Verify ALL tests still pass after refactoring
- [ ] ✅ Ensure no module exceeds 500 lines of code
- [ ] ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing KPT functions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 4.3 Completion Notes]
- KPTService.ts created (383 lines) providing metadata for 30+ built-in functions
- All KPT functions accessible via me.kpt in worker context
- KPTReference.svelte component exists for function discovery
- Worker integration complete with error handling
- 85+ tests covering KPT functionality

### Architecture Context

#### Service Layer Pattern
[Source: architecture-shards/4-architecture-patterns.md#Service Layer Pattern]
- Services implement async operations returning Promises
- State exposed via getters
- Events via callbacks for state changes
- Follow existing FirebaseService pattern for data operations

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture-shards/4-architecture-patterns.md#Component Architecture]
- New components go in src/lib/components/
- Services go in src/lib/services/
- Keep components under 500 lines (target <300)
- Extract business logic into services

#### State Management
[Source: architecture-shards/4-architecture-patterns.md#State Management]
- Use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect)
- Store files must use .svelte.ts extension
- Follow existing store patterns from sectionStore.svelte.ts

#### TypeScript Requirements
[Source: architecture-shards/6-component-specifications.md#TypeScript First]
- ALL new files must be TypeScript (.ts or .svelte with TypeScript)
- Use proper interfaces and types
- No 'any' types allowed

#### Firebase Integration
[Source: architecture-shards/3-technology-stack.md#Backend Services]
- Use Firebase Firestore 12.0.0
- Support offline persistence
- Follow existing collection patterns
- User authentication via Firebase Auth

#### Worker Context
[Source: Story 4.3 - public/workers/codeWorker.js]
- Custom functions must be added to createKPTNamespace (lines 47-211)
- Functions execute in sandboxed environment
- Access TPN values via me.getValue()
- No direct DOM access allowed

#### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture-shards/6-component-specifications.md#Clean Codebase Principles]
- Validate all user input before execution
- Sandbox custom function execution
- Prevent code injection attacks
- Audit trail for all changes

### File Locations
- Service: src/lib/services/KPTCrudService.ts (new)
- Component: src/lib/components/KPTFunctionEditor.svelte (new)
- Sub-components: src/lib/components/kpt/ directory (new)
- Tests: src/lib/services/__tests__/kpt-crud.test.ts (new)
- Worker updates: public/workers/codeWorker.js (modify)
- Firebase schema: Update firestore.rules and indexes

### Technical Constraints
- Custom functions must be pure (no side effects)
- Function names cannot override JavaScript reserved words
- Maximum function size: 10KB
- Validation must complete in <500ms
- Support offline mode with sync on reconnect

## Testing
[Source: architecture-shards/10-testing-strategy.md#Testing Patterns]
- Unit tests: 60% coverage for business logic (Vitest)
- Integration tests: 20% for service integration
- E2E tests: 20% for critical user flows (Playwright)
- Follow TDD workflow: Tests → Implementation → Refactor
- Test file location: __tests__ directories colocated with code
