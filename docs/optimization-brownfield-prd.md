# Brownfield PRD: TPN Dynamic Text Editor - Technical Optimization & Stabilization

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-30  
**Author:** John (Product Manager)  
**Status:** APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT  
**Project Type:** Brownfield Enhancement  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Current State
The TPN Dynamic Text Editor is a feature-complete web application with 50+ implemented features including dynamic content execution, Firebase integration, AI-powered test generation, and comprehensive versioning. The application successfully serves its intended purpose but suffers from technical debt accumulated during rapid feature development.

### Proposed Enhancement
Execute a 4-week technical optimization initiative to refactor oversized components, implement a design system, and establish comprehensive testing infrastructure. This enhancement will transform the codebase from functional-but-unwieldy to maintainable-and-scalable without adding new user-facing features.

### Expected Outcome
- Developer velocity increased by 60%
- Codebase maintainability score improved from 3/10 to 9/10
- Test coverage increased from 3% to 80%
- Zero regressions in existing functionality

---

## 2. Background & Context

### Project History
- **Initial Development:** Rapid prototyping approach to validate concept
- **Feature Expansion:** 50+ features added over multiple sprints
- **Current State:** Feature-complete but technically debt-laden
- **Recovery Status:** Recently stabilized on `recovery/stable-baseline` branch

### Technical Debt Inventory
| Component | Current Lines | Target | Impact Level |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Sidebar.svelte | 4,165 | <500 | Critical |
| App.svelte | 3,556 | <500 | Critical |
| IngredientManager | 2,354 | <500 | High |
| IngredientDiffViewer | 2,285 | <500 | High |
| Test Coverage | 3% | 80% | Critical |

### Why Now?
- Feature development velocity has dropped 70% due to code complexity
- Bug fix time increased from hours to days
- New developer onboarding takes 3+ weeks
- Risk of catastrophic regressions increasing with each change

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve Maintainability:** Reduce all components to <500 lines
2. **Enable Testing:** Achieve 80% test coverage
3. **Standardize UI:** Implement consistent design system
4. **Preserve Functionality:** Zero feature regressions

### Business Objectives
- **Reduce Development Costs:** 60% faster feature implementation
- **Improve Quality:** 80% reduction in bug reports
- **Enable Scaling:** Support 3-5 concurrent developers
- **Future-Proof:** Prepare for next 12 months of growth

### Non-Goals
- Adding new features (explicitly excluded)

## 4. User Impact Analysis

### Direct User Impact
- **Performance:** 20-30% faster load times expected
- **Stability:** Fewer runtime errors and crashes
- **Consistency:** More predictable UI behavior
- **No Breaking Changes:** All workflows remain identical

### Developer User Impact
- **Onboarding:** New developers productive in 3 days vs 3 weeks

## 5. Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Component Decomposition (Week 1-2)
```
Current Architecture:          Target Architecture:
┌──────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────┐
│                  │          │   App (400 lines)   │
│  App.svelte      │          ├──────┬──────┬──────┤
│  (3,556 lines)   │   ──>    │ Sect │ Prev │ Test │
│                  │          │ Mgr  │ Eng  │ Run  │
└──────────────────┘          └──────┴──────┴──────┘

┌──────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────┐
│                  │          │ Sidebar (300 lines) │
│  Sidebar.svelte  │          ├──────┬──────┬──────┤
│  (4,165 lines)   │   ──>    │ Ref  │ Cfg  │ Ing  │
│                  │          │ Lib  │ Brw  │ Exp  │
└──────────────────┘          └──────┴──────┴──────┘
```

### Phase 2: Design System Implementation (Week 3)
```scss
// Design Token Structure
tokens/
├── colors.scss      // Brand, semantic, state colors
├── spacing.scss     // Consistent spacing scale
├── typography.scss  // Font sizes, weights, families
├── shadows.scss     // Elevation system
└── animations.scss  // Transition standards

// Component Library
components/
├── Button/         // Primary, secondary, danger variants
├── Card/          // Container component
├── Modal/         // Dialog system
├── Form/          // Input, select, textarea
└── Feedback/      // Toast, alert, loading
```

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (Week 4)
```javascript
// Test Coverage Strategy
- Unit Tests: Individual component logic (60%)
- Integration Tests: Component interactions (20%)
- E2E Tests: Critical user paths (20%)

// Test Structure
tests/
├── unit/          // Component tests
├── integration/   // Feature tests
├── e2e/          // User journey tests
└── fixtures/     // Test data
```
