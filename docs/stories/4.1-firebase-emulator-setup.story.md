# Story 4.1: Firebase Emulator Setup & Migration Infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a fully configured Firebase emulator environment with migration utilities,
**so that** I can safely test all database changes and migrations before applying them to production.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Firebase emulator is configured and functional for local development
2. Backup and restore utilities are created using Firebase CLI
3. Data export/import scripts are implemented and documented
4. Safe collection reset procedures are established with proper error handling
5. Emulator-based development workflow is documented for team onboarding
6. NPM scripts are created for common emulator operations
7. CI/CD pipeline can run tests against emulator environment

## Tasks / Subtasks

### TDD Workflow (MANDATORY - Follow this exact order)
**Phase 1: Write Tests First**
- [x] Write unit tests for Firebase emulator configuration detection
- [x] Write tests for backup/restore utility functions
- [x] Write tests for safe collection reset procedures
- [x] Write tests for NPM script execution
- [x] Write integration tests for emulator connection
- [x] Write E2E tests for full emulator workflow

**Phase 2: Make Tests Pass (Minimal Implementation)**
- [x] Configure Firebase Emulator (AC: 1)
  - [x] Install Firebase CLI globally if not present
  - [x] Initialize Firebase emulator configuration in firebase.json
  - [x] Configure Firestore emulator with persistence
  - [x] Configure Auth emulator for testing
  - [x] Set up emulator UI access on port 4000
  - [x] Create .env.emulator file for emulator-specific config
  - [x] ✅ Verify all emulator configuration tests pass

- [x] Create Backup/Restore Utilities (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create scripts/firebase-backup.sh for automated backups
  - [x] Create scripts/firebase-restore.sh for restoration
  - [x] Implement timestamp-based backup naming
  - [x] Add backup validation checks
  - [x] Create scripts/firebase-export.js for selective data export
  - [x] Create scripts/firebase-import.js for data import with validation
  - [x] ✅ Verify all backup/restore tests pass

- [x] Implement Safe Collection Reset Procedures (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create scripts/safe-reset.js with collection existence checks
  - [x] Add empty collection initialization logic
  - [x] Implement rollback mechanism on failure
  - [x] Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations
  - [x] Create collection schema validators
  - [x] ✅ Verify all collection reset tests pass

- [x] Set Up NPM Scripts (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add "emulator:start" script with data import
  - [x] Add "emulator:export" script for saving state
  - [x] Add "emulator:clean" script for fresh start
  - [x] Add "emulator:backup" script
  - [x] Add "test:emulator" script for running tests against emulator
  - [x] ✅ Verify all NPM script tests pass

- [x] Update Application Code for Emulator Support (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add emulator detection in src/lib/firebase.ts
  - [x] Implement conditional connection to emulator
  - [x] Add development mode indicators in UI
  - [x] Update environment variable handling
  - [x] ✅ Verify all application integration tests pass

- [x] CI/CD Integration (AC: 7)
  - [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow to use emulator
  - [x] Add emulator startup in test pipeline
  - [x] Configure test data seeding
  - [x] Add emulator cleanup after tests
  - [x] ✅ Verify CI/CD pipeline tests pass

**Phase 3: Refactor for Maintainability**
- [ ] Extract emulator configuration into dedicated service class (max 300 lines)
- [ ] Create separate utility modules for backup/restore (max 200 lines each)
- [ ] Extract collection management into dedicated module
- [ ] Create reusable components for emulator status indicators
- [ ] Consolidate error handling into centralized service
- [ ] ✅ Verify ALL tests still pass after refactoring
- [ ] ✅ Ensure no module exceeds 500 lines of code
- [ ] ✅ Achieve minimum 80% test coverage

- [x] Document Emulator Workflow (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create docs/FIREBASE_EMULATOR_GUIDE.md
  - [x] Document setup instructions
  - [x] Add troubleshooting section
  - [x] Include example workflows
  - [x] Add team onboarding checklist

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture-shards/3-technology-stack.md#Development Tools]
- Test files location: tests/ directory for unit tests, e2e/ for E2E tests
- Testing frameworks: Vitest 2.1.8 for unit tests, Playwright 1.50.1 for E2E
- All Firebase operations should be tested against emulator first
- Coverage reporting should be maintained

### Firebase Configuration
[Source: architecture-shards/3-technology-stack.md#Backend Services]
- Firebase Firestore version: 12.0.0
- Features: Real-time sync, Offline persistence, User authentication
- Firebase Auth for anonymous sign-in and user management

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture-shards/4-architecture-patterns.md#Service Layer Pattern]
- Firebase service located at: src/lib/services/firebaseService.ts
- Environment configuration in .env files
- Scripts directory for utility scripts

### Key Implementation Details
- Firebase emulator typically runs on ports: 8080 (Firestore), 9099 (Auth), 4000 (UI)
- Use firebase.json for emulator configuration
- Emulator data is stored in .firebase/ directory (add to .gitignore)
- Connection to emulator requires: connectFirestoreEmulator() and connectAuthEmulator()

### Dependencies Required
- firebase-tools (npm install -g firebase-tools)
- Existing Firebase project configuration
- Environment variables for Firebase config

## Testing
- Unit tests for all utility scripts using Vitest
- E2E tests to verify emulator connection
- Manual testing checklist for backup/restore operations
- Performance benchmarks for emulator vs production
