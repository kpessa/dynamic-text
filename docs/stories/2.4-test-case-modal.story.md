# Story 2.4: Full-Screen Test Case Modal Interface

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** content developer working with dynamic sections  
**I want** test cases to open in a nearly full-screen modal  
**So that** I have more real estate to work with complex test configurations and multiple test cases simultaneously

## Priority
High - Improves developer workflow and testing experience

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Modal Trigger**: Clicking a "Manage Test Cases" button on a dynamic section opens the modal
2. **Modal Size**: Modal covers 90% of viewport width and height with proper padding
3. **Test Case Display**: All test cases for the section shown in an organized layout
4. **Edit Capabilities**: Can add, edit, delete test cases within the modal
5. **Variable Management**: Clear UI for managing test variables per test case
6. **Expected Output**: Dedicated area for defining expected output with syntax highlighting
7. **Live Preview**: Show test execution results within the modal
8. **Save/Cancel**: Changes are applied on save, discarded on cancel
9. **Keyboard Support**: ESC to close, Tab navigation between fields
10. **Responsive**: Works on screens down to 768px width

## Technical Requirements
- Svelte 5 with runes API
- Reuse existing modal patterns from TestGeneratorModal.svelte
- Integrate with existing test runner service
- Maintain compatibility with current test case data structure

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Modal Pattern Reference**
[Source: Existing modal components in codebase]
- TestGeneratorModal.svelte uses bindable props pattern
- Standard modal structure: overlay + content container
- Uses `isOpen = $bindable(false)` for parent control
- Event dispatching for parent communication

**Component Communication**
[Source: architecture/6-component-specifications.md#component-communication-pattern]
- Parent-Child via Props for data flow
- Event dispatching for child-to-parent communication
- Service integration for business logic

**Test Case Data Structure**
[Source: Current implementation in sectionManagementService.ts]
```typescript
interface TestCase {
  name: string;
  variables: Record<string, any>;
  expectedOutput?: string;
  expectedStyles?: string;
  matchType?: 'exact' | 'contains' | 'regex' | 'styles';
}
```

**Test Runner Integration**
[Source: src/lib/services/testRunnerService.ts]
- Service handles test execution logic
- Returns test results with pass/fail status
- Supports multiple match types for validation

**UI Components to Leverage**
[Source: Existing component inventory]
- CodeEditor.svelte for code editing areas
- ValidationStatus.svelte for test result display
- Use Skeleton UI modal patterns for consistency

### Implementation Architecture

**File Locations**
- New component: `src/lib/TestCaseModal.svelte`
- Update: `src/App.svelte` to integrate modal
- Update: `src/lib/components/SectionRenderer.svelte` to add trigger button

**State Management**
- Modal state managed by parent component
- Test cases passed as props
- Changes collected in modal, applied on save
- Use derived values for computed states

**Styling Approach**
- Follow existing modal styling patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Ensure dark mode compatibility
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create TestCaseModal Component (AC: 1, 2, 9)
- [x] Create new file `src/lib/TestCaseModal.svelte`
- [x] Set up modal structure with overlay and container
- [x] Implement 90% viewport sizing with responsive breakpoints
- [x] Add keyboard event handlers (ESC to close)
- [x] Add proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

### Task 2: Implement Test Case List View (AC: 3, 4)
- [x] Display all test cases for the section
- [x] Add visual indicators for active test case
- [x] Implement add new test case button
- [x] Add delete test case functionality with confirmation
- [x] Support reordering test cases (drag and drop or arrows)

### Task 3: Build Test Case Editor (AC: 5, 6)
- [x] Create form for editing test case name
- [x] Implement variable editor with add/remove capabilities
- [x] Integrate CodeEditor for expected output field
- [x] Add match type selector (exact/contains/regex/styles)
- [x] Support for expected styles field

### Task 4: Add Live Test Execution (AC: 7)
- [x] Integrate with testRunnerService
- [x] Display test results inline
- [x] Show actual vs expected output comparison
- [x] Add visual pass/fail indicators
- [x] Support for re-running individual tests

### Task 5: Implement Save/Cancel Logic (AC: 8)
- [x] Collect all changes in modal state
- [x] Implement save handler to update parent sections
- [x] Add cancel with confirmation if changes exist
- [x] Ensure proper cleanup on modal close

### Task 6: Add Trigger Button to Sections (AC: 1)
- [x] Update SectionRenderer component
- [x] Add "Manage Test Cases" button for dynamic sections
- [x] Wire up button to open modal with section data
- [x] Ensure button placement doesn't disrupt layout

### Task 7: Testing & Polish (AC: 10)
- [x] Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- [x] Verify keyboard navigation works correctly
- [x] Test with multiple test cases (10+)
- [x] Ensure no regression in existing test functionality
- [x] Add proper loading states and error handling

### Task 8: Documentation
- [x] Add JSDoc comments to new component
- [x] Update component inventory in architecture docs
- [x] Create usage examples in comments

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Component follows existing modal patterns
- [ ] No regressions in test case functionality
- [ ] Responsive design works on all target sizes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Manual testing passed
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **State Management Complexity**: Managing test case state between modal and parent
  - Mitigation: Use clear data flow pattern, validate state updates
  
- **Performance with Many Tests**: Modal might lag with 20+ test cases
  - Mitigation: Implement virtual scrolling if needed

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 90% modal might be too large for mobile
  - Mitigation: Adjust sizing for mobile breakpoints

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Open a dynamic section
2. Click "Manage Test Cases" button
3. Verify modal opens at 90% viewport size
4. Add a new test case
5. Edit variables and expected output
6. Run test within modal
7. Save changes and verify they persist
8. Cancel changes and verify they're discarded
9. Test ESC key closes modal
10. Test on mobile device or responsive mode

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for state management logic
- Component tests for modal interactions
- Integration tests with test runner service

## Dependencies
- Existing TestGeneratorModal.svelte for pattern reference
- testRunnerService for test execution
- sectionManagementService for test case updates
- CodeEditor component for code fields

## Handoff Notes
This story enhances the test case management experience by providing a dedicated workspace for complex test configurations. It follows established modal patterns in the codebase and integrates cleanly with existing test infrastructure.
