# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-08-30
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: **PASS** - Input sanitization present, sandboxed execution, Firebase auth integrated
- Performance: **PASS** - App.svelte reduced to 341 lines (90.4% reduction), proper code splitting achieved
- Reliability: **PASS** - Error handling present across 12 components (96 error handling occurrences)
- Maintainability: **CONCERNS** - Test coverage insufficient (2 tests for 21 components = 9.5% coverage)

## Critical Issues

1. **Test coverage at 9.5%** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Refactored components lack adequate test coverage
   - Fix: Add unit tests for 19 untested components, prioritizing:
     - SectionManager.svelte (core orchestration)
     - PreviewEngine.svelte (critical security component)
     - FirebaseSync.svelte (data persistence)
     - ImportExportManager.svelte (data integrity)

## Detailed Assessment

### Security - PASS
✅ **Strengths:**
- DOMPurify integration for HTML sanitization in PreviewEngine
- Babel transpilation for secure code execution
- Firebase authentication properly integrated
- Input validation present in components
- Rate limiting/throttling implemented in service layer (6 files)

### Performance - PASS
✅ **Achievements:**
- App.svelte: 341 lines (target: <500, achieved 90.4% reduction from 3,556)
- Proper component extraction completed:
  - SectionManager: 442 lines
  - PreviewEngine: 253 lines
  - TestRunner: 559 lines
  - FirebaseSync: 131 lines
  - ImportExportManager: 133 lines
- Svelte 5 runes properly used (94 occurrences across components)
- Component-based architecture enables lazy loading potential

### Reliability - PASS
✅ **Evidence:**
- Error handling present in 12/21 components
- 96 total error handling occurrences
- Try-catch blocks in critical components:
  - FirebaseSync: 10 error handlers
  - TPNImportModal: 30 error handlers
  - TPNExportModal: 13 error handlers
  - TPNConfigManager: 12 error handlers
- Graceful degradation patterns observed

### Maintainability - CONCERNS
⚠️ **Issues:**
- Only 2 test files for 21 components (9.5% coverage)
- Testing pyramid target: 60% unit tests not achieved
- Missing tests for critical extracted components
- Documentation exists but test coverage critical for refactored code

## Quick Wins

1. **Add unit tests for top 5 components**: ~8 hours
   - SectionManager, PreviewEngine, FirebaseSync (critical path)
   - ImportExportManager, TestRunner (data integrity)
   
2. **Add integration tests**: ~4 hours
   - Test component communication via events
   - Verify store synchronization
   
3. **Document component interfaces**: ~2 hours
   - Add JSDoc comments for public methods
   - Document event contracts

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Create unit tests for at least 5 critical components before marking story complete
2. **Short-term**: Achieve 60% test coverage target for extracted components
3. **Long-term**: Implement automated coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline

## Quality Score

```
Initial: 100
- 10 for Maintainability CONCERNS (test coverage)
Final Score: 90/100
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run existing tests
pnpm test:unit

# Check coverage (if configured)
pnpm test:coverage

# Verify component count
find src/lib/components -name "*.svelte" | wc -l

# Verify App.svelte line count
wc -l src/App.svelte
```
