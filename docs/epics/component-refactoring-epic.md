# Epic: Component Refactoring & Architecture Optimization

**Epic ID:** EPIC-2025-001  
**Created:** 2025-01-30  
**Product Owner:** John (PM)  
**Status:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks  

## Epic Overview

### Problem Statement
The TPN Dynamic Text Editor has reached full feature maturity with 50+ implemented features, but suffers from severe technical debt in the form of oversized components. The main application files exceed recommended size limits by 700-800%, making the codebase difficult to maintain, test, and extend. This technical debt is blocking developer velocity and increasing the risk of regressions.

### Business Value
- **Developer Productivity:** Reduce time to implement new features by 60%
- **Quality Assurance:** Enable comprehensive testing (target: 80% coverage)
- **Maintainability:** Reduce bug fix time from days to hours
- **Team Scalability:** Enable multiple developers to work simultaneously
- **Performance:** Improve build times and reduce bundle size

### Success Metrics
- âœ… All components < 500 lines of code
- âœ… Test coverage > 80%
- âœ… Zero functional regressions
- âœ… Build time < 30 seconds
- âœ… Developer satisfaction score > 8/10

## User Stories

### ðŸ”´ P0 - Critical (Week 1)

#### Story 1: Decompose App.svelte

- Extracted components: SectionManager, PreviewEngine, TestRunner, FirebaseSync, ImportExportManager
- All existing functionality preserved
- No performance degradation
- Component communication via props and events

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** None

#### Story 2: Refactor Sidebar.svelte
**As a** Developer  
**I want** Sidebar.svelte split into focused sub-components  
**So that** I can maintain and extend sidebar features independently  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sidebar.svelte reduced from 4,165 to < 500 lines
- Extracted components: ReferenceLibrary, ConfigBrowser, IngredientExplorer, SidebarSearch, SidebarNav
- Search functionality remains responsive
- Firebase integration unchanged
- Navigation state preserved across refactoring

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** Story 1 (recommended but not required)

### ðŸŸ¡ P1 - High Priority (Week 2)

#### Story 3: Refactor IngredientManager
**As a** Developer  
**I want** IngredientManager split into manageable components  
**So that** I can modify ingredient logic without affecting other features  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- IngredientManager reduced from 2,354 to < 500 lines
- Separate CRUD operations, UI, and state management
- Version history functionality intact
- Firebase sync maintained

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2  

---

#### Story 4: Refactor IngredientDiffViewer
**As a** Developer  
**I want** IngredientDiffViewer modularized  
**So that** diff logic can be reused across the application  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- IngredientDiffViewer reduced from 2,285 to < 500 lines
- Extract diff algorithm to utility
- Create reusable diff UI component
- Maintain side-by-side comparison

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 3  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ P2 - Enhancement (Week 3)

#### Story 5: Create Design System
**As a** Developer  
**I want** A consistent design system with tokens and components  
**So that** UI development is faster and more consistent  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal, Form controls)
- Documentation with examples
- Applied to at least 3 major components

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Stories 1-4 complete  

---

#### Story 6: Implement Component Testing
**As a** Developer  
**I want** Comprehensive tests for all refactored components  
**So that** We can refactor with confidence  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for data flow
- Test coverage > 80% for refactored code
- CI/CD pipeline validates all tests

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** Stories 1-4

## Technical Approach

### Refactoring Strategy
1. **Incremental Decomposition:** One component at a time
2. **Feature Flags:** New components behind flags initially
3. **Parallel Development:** Old and new components coexist during transition
4. **Test-First:** Write tests before refactoring
5. **Documentation:** Update as we go

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive E2E tests before starting
- **Risk:** Performance regression
  - **Mitigation:** Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- **Risk:** Lost developer context
  - **Mitigation:** Detailed documentation and code comments

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code follows new architecture patterns
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Performance metrics maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No increase in bundle size
- [ ] Accessibility standards maintained

## Dependencies & Blockers
- **Dependencies:** None - can start immediately
- **Blockers:** None identified
- **Resources Needed:** 
  - 1-2 developers full-time
  - Access to staging environment
  - Performance monitoring tools
